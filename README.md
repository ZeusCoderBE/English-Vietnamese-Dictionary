## Description:

The English-Vietnamese Dictionary project, developed as part of the Data Structures & Algorithms course, is a Windows Form application implemented in C#. The primary goal of the project is to provide an intuitive and efficient English-Vietnamese dictionary.

The dictionary utilizes a hashtable data structure to efficiently manage and retrieve word translations. This choice of data structure enhances the speed and performance of the dictionary, ensuring a seamless user experience.
